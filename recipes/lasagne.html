        <li>1 onion</li>
        <li>3 bay leaves</li>
        <li>3 cloves</li>

        <li>100g plain flour</li>
        <li>good grating of nutmeg</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the béchemel sauce by putting milk, onion, bay leaves and cloves into a large saucepan and bring very gently to the boil. Turn off the heat and set aside for 1 hour to infuse.</li>
        <li>For the meat sauce, put the oil, celery, onion, carrot, garlic and pancetta in another large saucepan. Gently cood together until the veg is soft but not coloured.</li>
        <li>Tip in the pork and beef mince, milk and chopped tomatoes. Stir together. When mince has broken down, stir in all the herbs, stock cubes and red wine, and bring to a simmer. Cover and cook for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Uncover and gently simmer for another 30mins-1 hour until the meat is tender and saucy. Taste and season.</li>
        <li>To finish the béchemel sauce, strain the milk through a fine sieve into one or two jugs. Melt the butter in the same pan, then mix in the flour and cook for 2 mins.</li>
        <li>Stir in the strained milk, a little at a time. Bring to a gentle simmer, stirring occasionally. Season with salt, pepper and grated nutmeg.</li>
        <li>Heat the oven to 180C. Spread a spoonful of meat sauce over the base of 3.5 litre baking dish. Cover with a single layer of dried pasta sheets. Spoon over a third of the meat sauce and scatter a little parmesan.</li>
        <li>Repeat the layers two more times to use all the meat sauce. Add a final layer of pasta, the last of the béchemel and remaining parmesan. Bake for 1 hour until bubbling, browned and crisp on top.A rich and creamy whole-wheat pasta dish filled layer by layer with refreshingly fresh onions and garlic, lathered in a succulent sauce and topped with imported, premium quality mozzarellaA rich and creamy whole-wheat pasta dish filled layer by layer with refreshingly fresh onions and garlic, lathered in a succulent sauce and topped with imported, premium quality mozzarella</li>
